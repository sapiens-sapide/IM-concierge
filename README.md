# IM-concierge
Manage your presence on chat rooms.  

IM-concierge allows you to :  
* Connect to your favorite chat rooms through any web navigator, from your desktop or on your way with your smartphone.
* Manage your **effective** online presence. IM-concierge shows to other rooms' participants if you're really online — when you're connected to IM-concierge — or if IM-concierge is currently surrogating your presence. So, other people stop seeing « online » or « connected » status for your nickname when you are not present. They'll see instead a different nickname when IM-concierge is surrogating for you. Nickname switching is automatically handled by IM-concierge on your connections or disconnections.
* Catch-up what people said on channels when you were disconnected. IM-concierge constantly records discussions on channels you're following. Pick up discussions where you left off when you reconnect.
* Keep a chat record. IM-concierge stores all events, messages, nicknames, links, attachments, etc. into a graph database. You can easily retrieve all kind of informations : who said what ? who spoke to whom ? what was the cool link my friend sent me last week ? etc.  
IM-concierge keeps a discussions logbook and exposes rich APIs to search within it.
